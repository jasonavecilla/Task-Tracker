# Functionality

- Initial Checklist Generation:
  - Utilize the provided JSON data to generate the initial matrix that lists categories and tasks on the left side and days of the month along the top (triggered by user).
  - Display checkboxes at the intersections of categories/tasks and days.
  - Generate the matrix only for the current month.
  - Determine the current month dynamically based on the system's date.
- Categories & Tasks
  - Display all available categories and their associated tasks on the left side of the matrix.
  - Populate the matrix with tasks listed under their respective categories.
- Days of the Month
  - Populate the top row of the matrix with the days of the current month.
  - Ensure correct alignment of dates based on the current month's calendar.
- Checkbox Intersections
  - Display checkboxes at the intersections of each task/category and the corresponding day of the month.
  - Populate checkboxes only for the specific date(s) tasks are to be completed, as mentioned in the JSON data.
  - Reflect completion status by dynamically checking/unchecking these checkboxes based on the completion status data.
- Additional Notes:
  - Upon completing a task (checking the corresponding checkbox), enable a feature to input additional notes related to that specific task.
  - Direct users to a dedicated page or modal window where they can type, edit, and save notes related to the completed task.
  - Implement a user-friendly text input field or area, enabling users to add comprehensive details or comments.
  - Include a "Save" or "Submit" button to store these notes and associate them with the completed task for future reference or review.
- Local Storage Implementation
  - Implement local storage functionality post-initial checklist generation.
  - Store the generated checklist in the local storage to persist user data beyond the initial session.
  - Update the checklist in the local storage whenever changes are made.
  - Introduce a "Save" button specifically for updating local storage.
  - On clicking "Save," capture the current state of the task list, including modifications and progress.
  - Store this updated data in the local storage to maintain the latest user changes.
- Dynamic Data Handling
  - Fetch and display only relevant tasks and days for the current month.
  - Handle cases where tasks may have different due dates within the month.
  - If the user clicks on a task that has been completed, remove the check mark. In other words, clicking toggles the checkmark
  - Click on task name to show additional detailed description in a popup
